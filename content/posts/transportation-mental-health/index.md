*This is an email I sent to Mayor Andy Fillmore and Councillors Hinch and White on Feburary 27, 2025. An extra link to his Windsor Street Exchange comments added and a couple terms expanded for longer-term context.*

Hi Mayor,

During [Tuesday's Windsor Street Exchange](https://pub-halifax.escribemeetings.com/Players/ISIStandAlonePlayer.aspx?Id=1a99836f-812a-4a9a-9fed-6e78ef8874d1&initial_seek=14422) item you said something about the impact of traffic or congestion on people's mental health.

I think you meant because they are sitting in their cars and somehow a new Windsor Street Exchange or other projects are going to "ease congestion" and help that. (We know that private vehicle congestion can never be "eased," except when the amount of private vehicles is reduced through mode shifts, congestion pricing, etc)

But here are some other transportation mental health aspects for you to consider.

First, there's the unrelenting traffic violence. People [are being killed](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dalhousie-king-s-lower-flags-student-killed-in-halifax-collision-1.7447252) or [seriously injured](https://globalnews.ca/news/10989708/family-speaks-out-nova-scotia-teen-hit-and-run/) trying to walk, cycle, and take transit around town. That takes a huge mental health toll on the people involved, their loved ones, and others who worry they could be next. As far as I know you have not said anything about this or these recent incidents. You did manage to call someone from Halifax Water in to your office about the boil water advisory, though, with a claim you'd keep it from happening again.

This morning, I was trying to ride my bike to get groceries. That involves crossing the commons, one of our busiest walking, rolling, and cycling connections. What did I encounter, along with all the other folks I saw trying to walk and cycle across?

An icy mess.

I know for myself and many others not having reliable ways to move around the city without resorting to a car takes a huge toll on mental health. There's been a lot of discussion recently in my friend group about where it's possible (or not) to cycle, walk, etc. People should not have to worry about that.

The city claims through the Integrated Mobility Plan, strategic priorities, even staff comments during the Windsor Street Exchange item that we want people walking, cycling, and taking transit. But our environment and actions supporting the environment do not align with that, especially in winter.

To get back home, I made a point to avoid all Active Transportation infrastructure because I couldn't trust it. Mixing with impatient and often angry drivers takes even more toll on my mental health.

Did I do something wrong this morning by trying to ride my bike to get groceries? Would you and the city prefer I be driving a car instead, adding to congestion?

I hope there are better transportation mental health days ahead, for all of us.
